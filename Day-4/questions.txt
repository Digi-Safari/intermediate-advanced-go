Tasks to perform:
    cmd package
        main.go ->
                   ,call setupRoutes() func,
                   start the server

        routes.go -> Create setupRoutes() that register one route for the app
                    /find
                    Route Details ->  GET     /find?user_id={id}       # Get a user by ID
                    Hint: Use this to fetch the query // r.URL.Query().Get("user_id")
    models package
        models.go -> create a struct that stores userDetails like name, email, password
                     create a preintialized global map that stores user details
                     For example :- map[int]User  , Note userId is int
        users.go -> write function named as GetUser() bool
                    that checks if a user is present in the map or not.

    handlers package
        handlers.go -> create a handler function that calls GetUser() from the models package
                       In handlerfunc write a basic check to make sure id received is a proper int
                       Note: Send Json based responses
                       use below technique to convert data to json and send responses
                       json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(variableName)
